					<h2 class="card-title">Our Story</h2>
					<p class="card-text">JMT was founded in 2025, when three classmates where forced to cooporate on a project to learn agile methods, specifically Scrum.
						Jeremias, Markus and Tilda wondered what they should do. Of course they wanted to succeed, however they also had individual assignments in another course that soon was due.
						In this hardship times, they put their first letters of names together and since that day, JMT Web Agency is thriving!
					</p>
					<p class="card-text">
						Since the agency isn't a real company, we don't have much to say. Nevertheless we would like some real companies to discover us and give us jobs from July 2026, when we graduate.
